# Reddit-Bot

### Project Description:
Our project is a bot that posts a motivational message per day in a subreddit.
The purpose of the bot is to help people who are feeling down and need a small message to motivate
them at the start of their day. All quotes are from famous authors, activists, and well-known public
figures. We wanted to have these quotes that are based on inspiring people in hopes of giving people
a small dose of encouragement to begin their day.

### Data:
We gathered each of our own quotes that organized them into an excel sheet.

### Language: 
Python

### Library:
- The Python Reddit API Wrapper (PRAW)
- Pandas
- itertools
